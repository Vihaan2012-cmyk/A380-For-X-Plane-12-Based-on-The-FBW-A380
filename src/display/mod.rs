//! The A380X's cockpit screens: FlyByWire's instruments draw a command
//! stream per screen (docs/display-stream.md) and this module shows them on
//! X-Plane cockpit devices (docs/screens.md).
//!
//! A new stream is read and tessellated once, when it arrives, on the
//! thread the instruments run on ([`Tess`]), and the mesh handed to the draw
//! side under a brief lock. X-Plane calls each device's draw callback every
//! frame, which uploads the vertices when the stream is new and replays the
//! cached batches into the device's texture, dimmed to its knobs. Mouse clicks,
//! drags and the wheel over a device come back as screen events for the
//! scripts, in the screen's CSS pixels.
